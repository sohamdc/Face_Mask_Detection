# Face_Mask_Detection
 Face mask detection using CNN and Keras: A computer vision task where a CNN model is trained on a dataset of "with_mask" and "without_mask" images. It learns to identify if a person is wearing a face mask or not. Keras simplifies model building, and the trained model can be deployed for real-time detection.
